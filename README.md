# netrw.nvim

**⚠️ This plugin is in an early development phase; I would not recommend using it. ⚠️**

This experimental Neovim plugin aims at providing the same functionality as the regular netrw file explorer but with a 
bit more *bling*. This plugin is meant for enjoyers of the [vinegar](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar) workflow
wanting to have something more configurable.

## Contributing
